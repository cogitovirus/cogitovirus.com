## cogitovirus manifesto


cogitovirus project is a collection of websites exploring memetics, strategic influence, digital aesthetics, and psychological operations.
We create frameworks to understand how ideas spread, how attention moves, and how perception is shaped.

From rook2root.co (competitive strategy) to memetics.cc (idea mechanics), each site is a module in a growing system of insight, creativity, and cognitive resilience.

Tools for thinking. Signals for sensing. Interfaces for the mind.
