## The Art of Not Reading

I'm writing this post from a hospital bed. Not close to dying in anyway, but recouperating from a couple of worst days in my life.

Have you ever wondered what would you leave behind if you had died today? A house or an apartment, some furtiture, books and electronics, maybe some photos of you with your loved ones. What usually comes first to mind are your material possessions.

> Your life in a faire sized box.

Now imagine your grandchild, whom you never met, that comes into possesion of those items and tries to piece together the person behind it. How well, if even, would those things describe you? Your dreams and struggles, everything that you stand for, your accomplishments and every failure and heartbreak after which you kept going.

You need to leave them more than that. You have to pass on your dreams, your struggles and aspirations. Your thoughts, your ideas, your creativity. Challanges that you faced and how you failed or overcame them. You need to leave them a piece of yourself. 

To leave all that, you have to start expressing yourself. By writing, creating art, painting, sculpting and if that's not your deal, then build, engineer and document every step of your journey. 

We're swollowed by our daily routines. Thrown into a mass media machine, with a simple goal to consume content.

Switch off your TV, Internet, sit in your place of focus, think and transfer it to your notebook on canvas.

Nothing in this world is this trivial anymore. Now you have to take that neural mucus or yours and mold it into an expression of yorself. Dissasemble your thoughts, inspect them closely, arrange them, put them back together, maybe in a different shape or order.

The key is to keep going. Start and never ever stop. Learn to hate it, leave it, and get back to it. Now all it's left to do is hope. That by the time you will be called to step down from the stage, your piece will be whole and you will be understood.

This post is titled the art of not reading. When I was writing it, I thought to myself, the point that I'm trying to make is too general. It's not even having anything to do with wasting time reading books/all over the internet. But them I thought to myself.

You're stil reading the post, aren't you?
