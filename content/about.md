**Hi there, stranger!**

My name is Wiktor Żołnierowicz. I’m a software engineer, and this is my space to publish ideas, projects, and essays.

-----

**What drives me is systematically creating things — whether it’s building software, writing something meaningful, or crafting hands-on projects. There’s a deep sense of satisfaction in turning ideas into reality, one *commit* at a time.**

-----

Outside of the digital world, I enjoy staying active. If I’m not coding or exploring new ideas, you’ll probably find me at the gym, training martial arts, or out on a run.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope to see you again. Don't be a stranger!

**Take care!**

*wzolni*
